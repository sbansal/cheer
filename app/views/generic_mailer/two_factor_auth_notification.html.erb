<p>Hello <%= @user.friendly_name %>.</p>

<% if @user.two_factor_enabled? %>
You have enabled Two Factor Authentication and added an extra layer of security to your Cheer account.
<% else %>
Two Factor Authentication has been disabled on your account. You no longer have an extra layer of security and we highly recommend you turn it back on to keep your account protected.
<% end %>

<p>If you did not initiate this change, please check your <%= link_to 'account', 'https://app.usecheer.com/accounts/settings'%> or reach out to us at <%=mail_to "security@usecheer.com"%> as soon as possible. You can also just hit reply to this email and we will get back to you urgently.</p>

<p>Hope you have a <i>Cheerful</i> day.</p>
